My first repository, a path to become a Data Science Ninja :) 

Hi, my name is Markus Andersson. I have an engineering degree majoring in Applied and Computational Mathematics at KTH/Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I work as an Data Scientist in a AI based startup, focusing in reading devolopment of children with the help of Eyetracking and AI/ML technologies.
